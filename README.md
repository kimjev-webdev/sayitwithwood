# sayitwithwood

The site’s navigation has been reorganized to prioritize clarity, usability, and alignment with core audiences. Chestnut fencing — the company’s signature product — is now given top billing under the “Fencing & Boundaries” category to immediately showcase what Say It With Wood is best known for. Following this, the “Rural Materials” section caters specifically to the needs of the primary audience: farmers, landowners, and estate managers looking for practical, sustainable materials for their land. Finally, “Garden & Outdoor Living” groups products that appeal more directly to our secondary audience — commercial clients, landscapers, and garden-focused customers — offering crafted features suited for decorative or recreational outdoor spaces. This hierarchy reflects both the brand’s identity and the expectations of its users.


NAVIGATION ORGANIZATION - FIRST AND FOREMOST NAVIGATON MENU HAS BEEN MOVED TO THE TOP OF THE PAGE WHICH  IS MORE CONVENTIONALLY APPROPRIATE. 

 1. Guides Users by Purpose, Not Just Product Names
Customers don’t always know exactly what product they need — they know what problem they're solving:

"I need something for my garden boundary…" → They’ll find Fencing, Screening, Gates together.

"I’m landscaping a new area…" → They’ll naturally look under Building Materials.

✅ Organizing by use-case helps users find what they’re looking for without already knowing your catalog.

🧠 2. Reduces Cognitive Load
The old list was long and flat — like reading a wall of text. This new structure:

Breaks the menu into smaller, scannable chunks

Gives users visual pauses via headers

Allows faster decisions with less mental effort

✅ Customers will feel more at ease and confident while browsing.

🔍 3. Highlights Your Product Diversity Without Overwhelming
By showing thoughtful groupings like:

Garden & Outdoor Living

Natural Resources

Firewood & Fuel

…you’re showing off the breadth of your offerings without creating decision fatigue.

✅ You educate your visitors while they browse — building trust and curiosity.

🛠 4. Supports Multiple Customer Types
This structure serves different types of visitors:

Builders and landscapers → go to Building Materials

Garden enthusiasts → head for Outdoor Living

Eco-conscious shoppers → find Biochar and natural resources

✅ Organizing by mindset means more people find what resonates with them.

✨ 5. Creates a Stronger Brand Impression
Having a section called Structures & Dreams nestled under Outdoor Living? That’s emotionally resonant. It tells the customer:

“We’re not just selling materials. We’re part of your vision.”

✅ It builds a sense of identity, story, and emotion around your offerings.

Summary:
This menu isn't just about navigation — it's about making your customer feel understood.

You're saying:

“We know how you think.”

“We grouped these thoughtfully for your convenience.”

“We respect your time and your project.”
